Every time we buy something â€” like an AC or any electronic device â€” thereâ€™s always that instruction paper inside.
Most of the time, it gets lost. And for every single product, companies have to print thousands of those papers â€” itâ€™s costly and not exactly eco-friendly either. ðŸŒ±

So I thought, why not make it digital and simple?

I built a small project that converts PDFs into QR codes, so people can just scan and read the manual anytime â€” no paper, no mess.

Built with HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, and Firebase.<img width="1349" height="627" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-30 223124" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b9fc35-0354-46a6-ba65-de898050eb89" />
